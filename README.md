The application processes the data and provides the user with a fair price for OpenSea platform tokens. All the user needs to do is find a link to the NFT he is interested in in OpenSea and send it to the application. He, in turn, will send his expert assessment.

The application updates the algorithms every week to be able to provide users with new products on the site. In the near future, the functions of “permanent collections” will appear, for which the bot will periodically update information. 

The bot's algorithm is based on a model for constructing a price index from “thousands of NFT transaction records".
